# ReinforcementLearning

This repository contains reinforcement learning environments and algorithms. The environments are based on this [repository](https://github.com/amiune/freecodingtour/tree/main/cursos/espanol/reinforcement_learning), with two versions:

1. A custom environment
2. A Gymnasium-compatible version of the same environment.

The following RL algorithms are implemented:

- **DummyAgent**: Is a simple agent that takes random actions in the environment without learning or adapting
- **QLearning**: Q-learning algorithm implemented.
- **DQN**: Deep Q-Network implemented using Gymnasium environment.
